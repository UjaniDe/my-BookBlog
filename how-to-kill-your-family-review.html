        Bella Mackie's *How to Kill Your Family* is a deliciously dark and satirical novel that follows Grace Bernard, a sharp, cynical, 
        and utterly compelling protagonist who calmly details her meticulous plan to murder every member of her estranged wealthy family. 
        From the opening line, Grace’s voice is captivating—witty, self-aware, and bitingly humorous.

        What makes this book stand out is the way Mackie balances the absurdity of the premise with a deep dive into themes of privilege, 
        family dysfunction, and justice. Grace is, by all accounts, a murderer—but she’s also oddly sympathetic. The novel doesn’t try 
        to excuse her actions but instead invites readers into her mind to understand the logic behind them.

        Structurally, the book plays out like a confession with journal-like entries and a plot that weaves between the past and 
        present. Mackie keeps the pacing sharp and suspenseful, with each chapter revealing just enough to keep the reader intrigued 
        without rushing the story.

        This is not your traditional thriller—it’s more a dark character study layered with social commentary. The irony in the title 
        is matched by the irony throughout the narrative. If you enjoy morally grey characters and a bit of dry British humor, 
        this book is likely to hit the mark.
      </p>

        It’s easy to imagine this being adapted into a stylized TV series, something with sharp writing and a killer lead actress. 
        Grace Bernard is not someone you’ll forget quickly.
